1. Open Terminal on your computer.

2. Type ssh-keygen in the Terminal and press Enter. This will generate a new SSH key pair.

3. You will be prompted to enter a file name for your key. You can accept the default location by pressing Enter.

4. You will be prompted to enter a passphrase. It is recommended to enter a passphrase for security purposes, but you can also leave it blank if you prefer.

5. Once the key pair is generated, type cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to display the public key in the Terminal.

6. Copy the entire public key that is displayed in the Terminal.

7. Go to your GitHub account settings and click on "SSH and GPG keys" in the left-hand menu.

8. Click on the "New SSH key" button.

9. Enter a title for your key, such as "My SSH Key".

10. Paste the public key you copied in step 6 into the "Key" field.

11. Click on the "Add SSH key" button to save the key to your GitHub account.

12. To test the SSH key, type ssh -T git@github.com in the Terminal. You should see a message that says "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."
