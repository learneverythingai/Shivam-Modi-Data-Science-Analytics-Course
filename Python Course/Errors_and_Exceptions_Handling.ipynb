        "## Exceptions \n",
        "\n",
        "**Exceptions** are a tool that programmers use to describe errors or faults that are _fatal_ to the program; e.g. the program cannot or should not continue when an exception occurs. Exceptions can occur due to programming errors, user errors, or simply unexpected conditions like no internet access. Exceptions themselves are simply objects that contain information about what went wrong. Exceptions are usually defined by their `type` - which describes broadly the class of exception that occurred, and by a `message` that says specifically what happened. Here are a few common exception types:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `SyntaxError`: raised when the programmer has made a mistake typing Python code correctly. \n",
        "- `AttributeError`: attempting to access an attribute on an object that does not exist \n",
        "- `KeyError`: attempting to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist \n",
        "- `TypeError`: raised when an argument to a function is not the right type (e.g. a `str` instead of `int`) \n",
        "- `ValueError`: when an argument to a function is the right type but not in the right domain (e.g. an empty string)\n",
        "- `ImportError`: raised when an import fails \n",
        "- `IOError`: raised when Python cannot access a file correctly on disk \n",
        "\n",
        "Exceptions are defined in a class hierarchy - e.g. every exception is an object whose class defines it's type. The base class is the `Exception` object. All `Exception` objects are initialized with a message - a string that describes exactly what went wrong. Constructed objects can then be \"raised\" or \"thrown\" with the `raise` keyword:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "raise Exception(\"Something bad happened!\") \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason the keyword is `raise` is because Python program execution creates what's called a \"stack\" as functions call other functions, which call other functions, etc. When a function (at the bottom of the stack) raises an Exception, it is propagated up through the call stack so that every function gets a chance to \"handle\" the exception (more on that later). If the exception reaches the top of the stack, then the program terminates and a _traceback_ is printed to the console. The traceback is meant to help developers identify what went wrong in their code. \n",

        "The way to read the traceback is to start at the very bottom. As you can see it indicates the type of the exception, followed by a colon, and then the message that was passed to the exception constructor. Often, this information is enough to figure out what is going wrong. However, if we're unsure where the problem occurred, we can step back through the traceback in a bottom to top fashion. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first part of the traceback indicates the exact line of code and file where the exception was raised, as well as the name of the function it was raised in. If you called `main(3)` than this indicates that `first_task_one_subtask_one` is the function where the problem occurred. If you wrote this function, then perhaps that is the place to change your code to handle the exception. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, many times you're using third party libraries or Python standard library modules, meaning the location of the exception raised is not helpful, since you can't change that code. Therefore, you will continue up the call stack until you discover a file/function in the code you wrote. This will provide the surrounding context for why the error was raised, and you can use `pdb` or even just `print` statements to debug the variables around that line of code. Alternatively you can simply handle the exception, which we'll discuss shortly. In the example above, we can see that `first_task_one_subtask_one` was called by `first_task_one` at line 46, which was called by `first` at line 30, which was called by `main` at line 14. \n",

        "## Catching Exceptions \n",
        "\n",
        "If the exception was caused by a programming error, the developer can simply change the code to make it correct. However, if the exception was created by bad user input or by a bad environmental condition (e.g. the wireless is down), then you don't want to crash the program. Instead you want to provide feedback and allow the user to fix the problem or try again. Therefore in your code, you can catch exceptions at the place they occur using the following syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # Code that may raise an exception \n",
        "except AttributeError as e:\n",
        "    # Code to handle the exception case\n",
        "finally:\n",
        "    # Code that must run even if there was an exception \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "What we're basically saying is `try` to do the code in the first block - hopefully it works. If it raises an `AttributeError` save that exception in a variable called `e` (the `as e` syntax) then we will deal with that exception in the `except` block. Then `finally` run the code in the `finally` block even if an exception occurs. By specifying exactly the type of exception we want to catch (`AttributeError` in this case), we will not catch all exceptions, only those that are of the type specified, including subclasses. If we want to catch _all_ exceptions, you can use one of the following syntaxes:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # Code that may raise an exception \n",
        "except:\n",
        "    # Except all exceptions \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "or \n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # Code that may raise an exception \n",
        "except Exception as e:\n",
        "    # Except all exceptions and capture in variable e \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it is best practice to capture _only_ the type of exception you expect to happen, because you could accidentaly create the situation where you're capturing fatal errors but not handling them appropriately. Here is an example:"
